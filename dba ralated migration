Dear Sir,
Today I had called for review meeting  with the database person and based on his observations we need to arrange for a meeting with PIMS application team and take confirmation on  implement the  findings so in the first stage we can achieve approx.. 50% of improvement in areas of database fine tuning, database security, database performance, data backup and database monitoring.
This exercise will add to faster database server performance and  prepare  us to plan for Database migration to new version 2016 in the coming months.
